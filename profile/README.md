Hi there! Welcome to ZinkML. [ZinkML](https://zinkml.com) is a zero-code data science platform that targets the data science industry with the mission of democratizing machine learning. It provides a visual and interactive interface, eliminating the need for complex coding. This allows users to focus on creating data science solutions rather than wrestling with data quality issues.

Our platform streamlines the entire data science workflow, including data ingestion, cleaning, processing, modeling, deployment, and analysis. This facilitates collaboration between technical and non-technical stakeholders and enables users to build and deploy models quickly and easily. In essence, Zinkml aims to make data science accessible to a wider range of users by removing the coding barrier.
